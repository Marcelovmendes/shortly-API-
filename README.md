## Description

Sharing a gigantic URL of a meme, video, or anything else on the internet with a friend can be an awkward situation. It gets even worse when the recipient of the link has no way to directly open it and is forced to manually type out the link character by character.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Setting Up the App

In your project's package.json file, make sure you have the following scripts defined:

```bash
$ "scripts": {
  "start": "node ./src/app.js",
  "dev": "npx nodemon ./src/app.js"}
```

These scripts allow you to start the application using Node.js and Nodemon for development.
